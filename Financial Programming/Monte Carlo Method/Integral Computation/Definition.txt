The Monte Carlo method for integral computation is a numerical technique that uses random sampling to approximate the value 
of a definite integral. It works by generating a large number of random samples within the domain of the integral, evaluating 
the function at each sample point, and then averaging the results to estimate the value of the integral. 

This method is particularly useful for high-dimensional integrals, or for integrals where the function is not well-behaved or 
is difficult to evaluate analytically. In the context of financial programming using C++, the Monte Carlo method can be used
to estimate the value of financial derivatives, such as options, by simulating the underlying assets' price movements.
