The Monte Carlo method is a computational method used to approximate solutions to mathematical problems.The method is used 
to model and analyze systems that involve randomness, probability, or uncertainty.

The idea behind the Monte Carlo method is to use random sampling to generate a large number of possible outcomes for a
given problem, and then use statistical analysis to determine the most likely outcome. This is done by randomly generating
a large number of inputs for a given problem, and then using these inputs to generate a large number of outputs. The 
results are then analyzed to determine the most likely outcome.

In finance, the Monte Carlo method is used to model the behavior of stock prices, interest rates, and other financial 
variables, and to analyze the risk of different investment strategies.
