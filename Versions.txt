Sure, here is a summary of the main new features and improvements introduced in C++11, C++14, C++17 and C++20:

C++11:

- The introduction of a new keyword "auto" for type inference
- The introduction of a new keyword "nullptr" to replace the use of NULL
- The introduction of lambdas (anonymous functions)
- The introduction of the "for each" loop
- The introduction of new concurrency features such as thread and atomic

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C++14:

- The introduction of binary literals and digit separators
- The introduction of generic (polymorphic) lambda expressions
- The introduction of the "return type deduction" for normal functions
- The introduction of the "relaxed constexpr" function
- The introduction of the "make_unique" function

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C++17:

- The introduction of "structured bindings"
- The introduction of "if constexpr" statement
- The introduction of "fold expressions"
- The introduction of "guaranteed copy elision"
- The introduction of "inline variables"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C++20:

- "Concepts" which are a new way to express constraints on template arguments
- "Ranges" which are a set of new algorithms and views to simplify working with sequences of elements
- "Modules" which is a new way to organize and manage code
- "Coroutines" which are a new way to write non-preemptive, resumable functions
- "The spaceship operator" which is a shorthand for three-way comparison
- "Designated initializers" which is a way to initialize structs and arrays in a more readable way
- "Template parameter lists for generic lambdas" which allows the use of template parameter lists with generic lambdas
- "The format library" which is a new standard library for formatting text
- "The std::jthread class" which is a new standard library for portable, joinable threads with destructors that block
- It's important to note that not all compilers fully support all the new features of the latest standard yet, so you may need to 
  check the documentation of your compiler to see which features are supported.
